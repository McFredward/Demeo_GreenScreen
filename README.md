# Demeo_GreenScreen

## How To Define Your Own Background Color
* Create the file `custom_color.ini` in your `BepInEx\plugins` Folder (where the .dll is located) and insert the following:

```ini
[CustomColor]
R=0
G=0
B=255
```

Feel free to adjust the values as desired, ensuring they stay within the range of 0 to 255 for each component. <br>
Additionally, please update the color in the VirtualDesktop configuration accordingly. <br>
If you discover a color or configuration that, in your opinion, performs better than the default green, let me know :)

## Known issues

* Visible outlines around some objects (Depends on your passthrough configuration in Virtual Desktop)
* You can look through some parts of some objects which also have the same color (e.g. the Swiftness Potion Card for the default green background).
